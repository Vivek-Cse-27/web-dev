# 🌱 My Web Development Journey

Welcome to my growing collection of frontend projects! As a fresher exploring the world of web development, I recently completed my CSS fundamentals and realized—like most of us do—remembering all those CSS properties isn’t easy 😅. But mastering them? That takes real practice.

So here I am, building and sharing my mini projects using HTML and basic CSS. This space is a testament to that learning journey.
